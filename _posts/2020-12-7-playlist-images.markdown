# [Spotify Playlist Image Changer](https://playlistchanger.herokuapp.com/)

As someone who uses Spotify as their primary service to listen to music, I simply do not understand why we can't change the images of playlists that we create from inside their Android/iOS App and have to either use the desktop app or find a 3rd Party service. I couldn't find one that just did that and wasn't bloated. So I took matters in my own hands. Hope [this](https://playlistchanger.herokuapp.com/) helps you as much as it did me.


It would ask you to login into your spotify account when you first go to the webpage.
